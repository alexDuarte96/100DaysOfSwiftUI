# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
In order to finish get my Master's Degree 🎓, I'm building an iOS AR app 👨🏽‍💻📱 so here is my journey in developing it.

While I'm no new to programming, there's still a lot that I can learn.
So I'm starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge to learn SwiftUI in order to get my degree.
Starting from the very basics (variables, strings, if, loops, and so on) to developing at least basic apps.

## Swift (First ~15 Days)
The first 15 days or so, I'll be dividing my progress by:
- **Days:** trying to learn at least one topic daily in Xcode Playgrounds. (Basics are important).
- **Checkpoints:** exercises to practice what I've learned. (Practice is key).

## Swift UI (Days 16 - 80)
Later on, I'll be developing small apps to get my SwiftUI skills.
>*Proyects to be declared later on*

## Master's Degree AR App.
Finally, I'm going to develop my AR app. Sadly, I won't be uploading that code here due to sensitive data used on it.
But my progress will be updated on my Twitter [@duarte96d](https://twitter.com/duarte96d) so you can check it out!
